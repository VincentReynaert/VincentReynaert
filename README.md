# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

## ðŸŽ“ About Me
I hold a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Virtual Reality (VR)**. My PhD thesis, defended in 2021, focused on **muscle fatigue in mid-air interactions in VR**, exploring the impact of hand synchronization, rhythm, and control-display ratio (CDR) on fatigue and user experience. Since then, I have been working on the use of **VR in education**.

Currently, I am a **lecturer at Piktura** (a visual arts school), where I teach:
- **Algo for L1 students**
- **Game Engine (Unity 2D) for L2 students**
- **Virtual Reality (VR) for M1 students at Piktura**

Additionally, I collaborate with other schools and faculties on **Virtual Reality**.

I am also conducting research within the **ETHICS Lab (EA7446) at UniversitÃ© Catholique de Lille**, focusing on **immersion in educational environments**.
